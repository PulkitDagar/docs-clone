The application's frontend is built using React, incorporating the Quill.js editor and Material-UI library for a sleek and user-friendly interface. On the backend, the server is powered by Node.js and Express, with Socket.io facilitating real-time communication between users. The MongoDB database is utilized to store and manage document data.
